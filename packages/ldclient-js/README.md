# LaunchDarkly SDK - Main JavaScript Package

This file contains the `ldclient-js` package, which is the standard interface for the LaunchDarkly SDK for browser JavaScript. It is described in the [main README](../../README.md).

This package automatically imports `ldclient-js-common`, which provides much of the underlying implementation.
